# Overview

Deck Dungeon (a.k.a. DD)  is a 1-6P turn-based RPG with no story, with combat centered around the 52 card deck and its four suits. The game was ostensibly created in 2016-17 as a lightwieght alternative to the complexities of in-depth board games like Dungeons and Dragons. 

The full rules and gameplay can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EloElrXnZyPq-PE6W4k3NOFtd-PRkar955rUnkoZd_I/edit)

This python arcade "port" of DD is one player, and some of the more complex mechanics of DD are notably absent, primarily the "class abilities," excluding the gambler class.
